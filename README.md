# RISC-Machine-Simple
a simple RISC machine written in system verilog that can execute 16-bit-encoding ARM assembly instructions including branch instructions. The instructions are read and executed from initialized memry in sequence. The instruction encodings are as follows

This is a personal course project that started from scratch to Finite State Machine Controll, Datapath, Basic Arithmetic and Logic Instructions Implementation, Adding Memory and IO, and Branch Instructions Implementation. The simple RISC is controlled using finite state machines designed in Verilog. It is simulated in ModelSim, synthesized with Quartus II, and demonstrated on De1SoC
